# STM32 Yocto Meta-Layer Guide

## 1. Define Scope
What will your meta-system do?

- Select a board
- Configure pins
- Compile code
- Flash binaries

## 2. Choose Programming Tools
Use appropriate tools to implement the meta-system:

- **Python**, **CMake**, or other scripting languages for automation.
- Integrate STM32-specific toolchains such as **arm-none-eabi-gcc**.

## 3. Abstract Board Configurations
Create templates for STM32 board families (e.g., F1, F4, H7 series).

## 4. Implement Workflow Automation
Automate tasks such as:

- Code generation
- Compiling
- Flashing

## 5. Integrate Debugging and Testing
Optionally include tools for debugging and testing:

- **GDB** for debugging STM32 applications.

## 6. Provide a User Interface
Offer a convenient interface for users:

- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Web-based interface

## Key Components for Your Meta-Layer

### 1. STM32 Toolchain
- **Cross-compilation toolchain**: Use `arm-none-eabi-gcc` or similar.
- Option to write a recipe to fetch and build the toolchain or include precompiled binaries.

### 2. STM32 Firmware Development Framework
- **STM32 HAL/LL libraries**: For hardware abstraction.
- Frameworks like **Zephyr** or **FreeRTOS** (if applicable).
- CubeMX-generated initialization code, if required.

### 3. Build System
- Recipes to build user applications targeting STM32 boards.
- Integration of build systems like **CMake** or **Makefiles**.

### 4. Flashing and Debugging Tools
- Use tools like **st-flash**, **openocd**, or **pyocd** for programming STM32 binaries.
- Recipes for downloading and installing these tools.

### 5. Board Configuration
- Define **machine configurations** (MACHINE) for different STM32 board families.
- Create templates for common configurations (e.g., GPIO setup, peripherals).

### 6. Optional: User Interface
- Script or small GUI to simplify interaction with the meta-layer.

## 7. Additional Considerations

### Custom Kernel
- If using an RTOS like **Zephyr**, integrate its kernel with the Yocto build system.
